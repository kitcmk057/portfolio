Data Analytic with AI - Comparable analysis in Corporate Finance

In this project, I tackle the challenge of inconsistent criteria in comparable analysis within the HK corporate finance sector by developing an AI and machine learning-based solution. This innovative approach employs a Language Model for data extraction and summarisation, vector similarity search for identifying analogous companies, and Tableau for visualising results, thereby enhancing decision-making for buyers and investors.
